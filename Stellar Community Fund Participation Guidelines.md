# Stellar Community Fund Participation Guidelines

The Stellar Community Fund (SCF) gives the broader Stellar community the opportunity to vote on which projects they believe deserve XLM awards. Any project built on Stellar can apply and participate!

## Two Fund Types
There are two community funds available for entry, the “Seed” and “Lab” funds. Below we will give a general overview of each and then get into rules and general guidelines for both funds. There are some key differences between the two funds so pay close attention.

### The Lab Fund
#### Goal
To inspire experimental use cases, open-source software, documentation, events, market presence, and real-world stress tests.

#### Structure
- 4 times per year, 500,000 XLM is split between ~12 projects
- 2 month runs with 1 month breaks
- Of initial entries, ~12 are chosen by a nomination panel of SDF and Community members
- Final amount allocation is determined by quadratic community vote
- Strong emphasis on open-source and public-content contributions

#### Qualifications
This fund is an entry point for exploration and discovery.  It's designed to encourage and support wide and varied ecosystem experimentation, and will have lower prize amounts, higher frequency, and more entrants than the Seed Fund. The bar for eligibility is therefore quite low: use, talk about, or showcase Stellar in some way and you’re welcome to participate. There’s a nomination panel to filter out ineligible entries and to select the ~12 best for the final community vote, but the idea is all are welcome to try and keep trying.

The Lab Fund is a fund for work completed or proven not for a promise of future work. There should be a live element to your entry or a history demonstrating your ability and qualification to carry out your intentions.

### The Seed Fund
#### Goal
To help viable, innovative, first-mover businesses and utilities get started on Stellar.  These are projects that will still be around in a year.

#### Structure
- 2 times per year, 5,000,000 XLM is split between 3-5 projects
- 5 month runs with 1 month breaks
- Of initial entries, 3-5 are chosen by a nomination panel of SDF and community members
- Final amount allocation is determined by quadratic community vote
- Strong emphasis on long term, real world, viable business applications

#### Qualifications
This fund is designed for established entrepreneurs and teams looking to break into the digital value store and transfer game. We’re seeking to support early-stage Stellar development in long-term utilities for the ecosystem (e.g. Stellar Expert, Stellar Beat) and in viable, for-profit, businesses building products and services for the world (e.g. Coinqvest, DSTOQ, Lobstr).

Applicants for the seed fund will provide a business model as part of their project submission, and the nomination panel will base qualifications for participation off both that plan and a proven track record of building and contributing to successful endeavors. The panel will be looking for ideas that can survive successfully for at least a year.

## Timeline
Each SCF round consists of 4 phases. 

### The Submission Phase
During this phase, participants submit their proposals to [communityfund.stellar.org](https://communityfund.stellar.org). This phase runs concurrently with the panel selection phase so don’t leave your submissions till last minute.

| Fund | Duration
|-|-
| Lab | 5 weeks
| Seed | 10 weeks

### The Panel Selection Phase
The task of the panel is to select from the total pool of entries a final list of the strongest entries which will proceed into the final community phases. This phase runs concurrent with the submission phase and is critically important for ensuring the best projects rise to the surface, gaining valuable feedback and expert insight and advice from our panel of SDF and community judges.

| Fund | Duration | Select
|-|-|-
| Lab | 5 weeks | ~12
| Seed | 10 weeks | 3-5

### The Community Discussion Phase
This is the participation and learning phase. Discussion and community participation is highly encouraged. It is fundamentally the most important part of the Stellar Community Fund. Not only does it give participants valuable feedback, it allows them to position themselves as advocates for their proposal and overall growth of the ecosystem.

This round is strictly dedicated to the sharing and discussion of project proposals within the community. Community members should take this time to ask participants questions about their proposals, submit suggestions, and engage with any active elements.

| Fund | Duration
|-|-
| Lab | 3 weeks
| Seed | 6 weeks

### The Community Vote Phase
Projects have been entered, the panel has narrowed down the field, discussion has happened, the community is ready. It’s time to vote out the prizes! Through a quadratic community vote, prize amounts are allocated by percentage share of the voting total out to the eligible entries. For example, if a project receives 10% of the quadratic vote, they will receive 10% of the awarded lumens (50,000 XLM of the 500k XLM pool). [How to Vote in the Stellar Community Fund](#)

| Fund | Duration | Prize
|-|-|-
| Lab | 1 week | 500,000 XLM
| Seed | 2 weeks | 500,000,000 XLM

## Proposal Submission
All proposals must be submitted to [communityfund.stellar.org](https://communityfund.stellar.org). Please be as detailed and thorough as you can. Don’t rush this, prepare your entry beforehand, be preparing for your round long before submissions open and you’ll have a better chance than those that simply rush into it without having built anything yet.

## Submission Eligibility
Applicable law and our internal policies restrict us from providing lumen awards for certain categories of projects. If your project is in one of our prohibited categories, it will not be eligible for an award. If you are unsure whether your project falls inside these one or more of these categories, please contact us and verify.

Regardless of the panel or community voting outcome, a submission will be ineligible to receive an award if it:
- violates any applicable laws, regulations, orders, judgments, decrees, guidance, or other legal authority;
- involves, facilitates, supports, or promotes unlawful activities, including, but not limited to: fraud, drug trafficking, purchases on dark web markets, theft, illegal arms trafficking, human trafficking, abduction, extortion, embezzlement, corruption of public officials, acts of terrorism or terrorist financing, and intellectual property violations;
- involves, facilitates, or promotes gambling;
- is offensive, deceptive, harmful, or libelous;
- is or contains sexually obscene content;
- is discriminatory or abusive toward any individual or group;
- contains, transmit, or instills malware or phishing pages or devices; or
- infringes or violates any proprietary right of any party, including patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, right of privacy, right of publicity, or other rights.

## Participant Eligibility
SDF intends to comply with all applicable laws and regulations in the distribution of lumen awards. All winners will be required to submit KYC documentation and fill out an applicable tax form. Failure to submit appropriate documentation or failure to pass our KYC checks will result in your rewards being forfeit. These tax forms will be used for accounting and tax reporting purposes so please be aware of your country’s applicable laws regarding tax-filing. Lumens will be reported at closing price on the day they are sent to you.

You must be at least 18 years of age to participate in SCF, unless your country's minimum age for receiving a cryptocurrency award is older, in which case you must meet the minimum age applicable in your jurisdiction. 

Unfortunately, if you’re a national or resident of Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, Sudan, or the region of Crimea, we are unable to send you any Lumens. Additionally, we may also be unable to send Lumens to winners in countries where local law makes it unlawful for residents to hold or receive cryptocurrencies. Please note, we currently cannot send Lumens to residents of the US states of Alabama, New York, Georgia, Connecticut, New Mexico, Hawaii, Vermont, and Washington.

Current Ecosystem Infrastructure Grant recipients are not eligible to participate in the Seed Fund though they may participate in the Lab Fund.

While you may resubmit “losing” proposals there should be significant improvements or pivots to your initial pitch, otherwise your entry will be considered ineligible.

## Manipulation and Disqualification
While this is a community fund, the SDF retains the right to disqualify entries and timeout participants without warning or explanation in order to maintain a fair and profitable experience for everyone. If we find you’re acting in bad faith, we may bar you from participating in future rounds as well.

Engaging in vote manipulation will cause your proposal to be disqualified. This includes botspam, fake/sock puppet accounts, and brigading. Participants who leverage sockpuppet accounts to submit proposals, friends to submit proposals, or any similar “act of bad faith” will be disqualified. SDF has the right to withhold awards from participants who have abused these eligibility requirements.

Participants who create fake accounts to bypass the above rules will be disqualified. This is regardless of whether or not they win a round.

What we're looking for is organic, genuine interest and discussion around your project. Foster and encourage that. Be kind and supportive to your fellow competitors.

Please feel free to share direct entry links with your own community but please don’t mass-message strangers or attempt to "game" the system in any way.  People should upvote things they genuinely like or find interesting, not because they were peer pressured or incentivized to do so.

If you suspect foul play and would like SDF to investigate, or if you have suggestions for future rounds of the community fund, please [fill out this form](https://stellarform.typeform.com/to/wIaj2S). 

Please do not use the SCF Keybase team for defamation either of the program or of individual participants. Such behavior is a bannable offense.
