# How to Judge the Stellar Community Fund

So you’re an SCF panel judge, congratulations, you’re a key member of the Stellar community! What does it mean though to be a judge in the Stellar Community Fund? Why do we even have this panel of judges? This article aims to answer these questions.

## Why a Panel of Judges?
Stellar has a varicolored past of ecosystem community funding. From the early days of the Stellar Build Challenge to the more recent Stellar Community Fund the SDF has always seen the value in open ecosystem funding but has often wrestled to land on the right design or track for iterating it’s efforts in the best, most meaningful direction. These roads have led us here, to a hybrid community panel of judges and the greater globe of voters. What was a pendulum swing too far on the centralized side to a far too open and exposed community vote has fallen to a two group, two phase process, entries quadraticly funded by the greater community but first selected by you the panel.

## How does the Panel Work?
The panel will handle narrowing the field of SCF round submissions down to a final list. They'll vet all entries, individuals and teams, and choose 3-5 projects (in the case of the Seed Fund) or ~12 projects (in the case of the Lab Fund) for inclusion in the final Lumen allocation phase. The nomination panel will filter out potential scams and technically weak or unachievable entries, and will present a strong and consistent pool of projects for quadratic community vote.  

## Who are the Panel Judges?
The panel judges are the members of the `scf_panel` Keybase team, a roughly 50 person mix of SDF and key Stellar community members. From this pool of judges 10-person selections will form individual round jury pools, each of which will be made up of 4 SDF employees and 6 community participants. Unlike actual jury pools however participation will be voluntary in any given round. If you are selected and opt out names will be drawn again until a full team is assembled. Selection will happen via Keybase’s `/flip` command.

If you’re one of the top 4 in an SDF flip or top 6 in a Community flip you’re in for that round.

Finally if you’re a Community judge who would like to participate in either the Seed or Lab fund you’re more than welcome to though obviously you won’t be a judge in your own round, we’ll just exclude you from that flip.

## What does a Panel Judge do?
Now to the nitty gritty of how judging will actually work and what the expectations will be from you.

Judging an SCF round is a serious task, and while we aren’t asking for unreasonable time commitments, we do expect you to take your responsibilities seriously and if you don’t have the brain or time bandwidth for this please opt out from being a judge. You’re standing as a gatekeeper and while we aim to be as decentralized as possible the task of the panel is to filter out potential scams and technically weak or unachievable entries, and to present a strong and consistent pool of projects for community vote.

Be objective, be realistic, be understanding, be respectful. Remember and realize the differences between judging the Seed and Lab funds. Act as a mentor, ask questions, suggest improvements. Relatively long periods of time have been left for submission and review so take advantage and pace yourself. Discuss with entrants, discuss with fellow panel reviewers, this isn’t just about accomplishing a task its about building relationships and fostering success. A new best friend, colleague or partner may be right on the other side of your screen.

Judging will happen on the same site and in the same format as community voting, via [communityfund.stellar.org](http://communityfund.stellar.org/) with the only difference being you must login with your Keybase account rather than a phone number. [How to Vote in the Stellar Community Fund](#)

## Questions?
As you have questions feel free to ask in the `scf_panel` Keybase group or DM `tyvdh` or `kolten`. This is a community initiative so while I may publish the draft it’s up to all of us to contribute to the final product.
