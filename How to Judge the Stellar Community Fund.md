# How to Judge the Stellar Community Fund

So you’re an SCF panel judge. Congratulations! You’re a key member of the Stellar community! What does it mean to judge the Stellar Community Fund? Why do we even have this panel of judges? This article aims to answer those questions.

## Why a Panel of Judges?
In previous iterations of the SCF, there were two rounds of community voting — a nomination round and a final lumen allocation round — and it required a lot of effort to participate in both.  There was a real problem with voter fatigue, and it was hard for community members to really dig in and evaluate projects in a meaningful way. By vetting all entries, individuals, and teams, and filtering out potential scams and technically weak or unachievable entries, the nomination panel makes it easy for the community to weigh in on a strong and consistent pool of projects. 3-5 in the case of the Seed Fund; ~12 in the case of the Lab Fund.

## Who are the Panel Judges?
The panel judges are the members of the `scf_panel` Keybase team, a roughly 50-person mix of SDF and key Stellar community members. From this pool, a 10-person selection of 4 SDF employees and 6 community participants forms each round's jury. Unlike actual jury pools, participation will be voluntary. If you are selected and opt out, names will be drawn again until a full panel is assembled. Selection will happen via Keybase’s `/flip` command.

If you’re one of the top 4 in an SDF flip or top 6 in a Community flip, you’re in for that round.

Finally if you’re a Community judge who would like to participate as an entrant in either the Seed or Lab fund, you won’t be eligible to judge in your own round. We’ll just exclude you from that flip.

## What does a Panel Judge do?

First and foremost, familiarize yourself with the [Stellar Community Fund Participation Guidelines](#).

Judging an SCF round is a serious task, and while we aren’t asking for unreasonable time commitments, we do expect you to be thoughtful and responsible, and to give entries due consideration.  If you don’t have the brain or time bandwidth for a given round, please opt out.

Be objective, be realistic, be understanding, and be respectful. Make sure to take the differences between the Seed and Lab funds into account when judging. Act as a mentor, ask questions, and suggest improvements. We've built in a lot of time for review, so pace yourself, and make sure to discuss projecwith entrants and fellow judges. The goal is to build relationships and foster success. A new best friend, colleague, or partner may be right on the other side of your screen.

Judging takes place on the same site and in the same format as community voting, via [communityfund.stellar.org](http://communityfund.stellar.org/)/. The only difference ist that you must log in with your Keybase account rather than a phone number. [How to Vote in the Stellar Community Fund](#)

## Questions?
If you have questions feel free to ask in the `scf_panel` Keybase group or DM `tyvdh` or `kolten`. This is a community initiative, so while we may publish the draft it’s up to all of us to contribute to the final product.
