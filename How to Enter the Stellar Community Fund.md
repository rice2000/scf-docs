# How to Enter the Stellar Community Fund

Entering the SCF is a simple and straightforward process: just log in to [communityfund.stellar.org](http://communityfund.stellar.org/) with your phone number, then head over to the “Enter” page. 

Here are the line items you will find in the entry form:

### Title
Pretty obvious, but be sure and spend some time thinking through the right title for your project. First impressions are important.  Titles are the stickiest part of your entry, and a good title makes people say, “have you heard of {XYZ}?” instead of, “what was the name of that project again?” 

### Image
The visual mental bookmark for your entry. It’s another place for an easy quick win to set yourself apart for the pack. Don’t just screenshot your app: really think through and design something visually appealing.

### Video
Don’t skimp here.  If you’re in a rush, step away and come back when you have some time. Winning the SCF is a sales pitch: it’s all about building relationships and storytelling. To convince the judges and community that your project is worthwhile, get in front of a camera, get us in your elevator, and make your pitch.

### Summary
A word format for the script of your video. What would you tell me about your project if we met over coffee? What would you say if you could only say a bit? What is the “why” of your entry?

### Description
Details, details, details.  You’ve convinced us to click on your entry, you’ve got our attention, now wow us.  Take us on a journey through your brain and passion. Spare no details, really flood the feed with everything. This box supports markdown, so go nuts.

### Links
Link to all the places: website, blog, GitHub, Instagram you name it. We want to see what you’ve built.  We want to get to know you and your team. Show us your place on the Internet.

### Tags
Make it snappy and keep it relevant.  What keywords would someone use to find you on Google?

### Identity
This list is only shared with the panel. We’re looking for email, Keybase, Telegram, phone number, etc. Any and all the places we can get in touch with you to talk about your project. The SCF is about relationships, so make sure we have some bridges to get to you.
