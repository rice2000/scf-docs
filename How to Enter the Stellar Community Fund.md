# How to Enter the Stellar Community Fund

Entering the SCF is a very simple and straight forward process, simply log into [communityfund.stellar.org](http://communityfund.stellar.org/) with your phone number and then head over to the “Enter” page. Let’s go over the line items you will find in the entry form 1 by 1.

### Title
Pretty obvious and straight forward but be sure and spend some time thinking through the right title for your project. First impressions are important. Titles are the stickiest part of your entry, the first bit of recall helping to distinguish between “what was that project” and “have you heard of {XYZ}?”

### Image
The visual mental bookmark for your entry. It’s another place for an easy quick win to set yourself apart for the pack. Don’t just screenshot your app, really think through and design something sticky and visually appealing.

### Video
Don’t skimp here, if you’re in a rush step away and come back once you’re not. Winning the SCF is a sales pitch. It’s all about relationship and storytelling. Convince the judges and community, get in front of a camera, get us in your elevator and make your pitch.

### Summary
A word format for the script of your video. What would you tell me about your project if we met per chance over a coffee? What would you say if you could only say a bit? What is the “why” of your entry?

### Description
Details details details, you’ve got us to click on your entry, you’ve got our attention, now wow us, take us on a journey through your brain and passion. Spare no details, really flood the feed with everything. This box supports markdown so go nuts.

### Links
Link to all the places. Website, blog, GitHub, Instagram you name it. We want to see what you’ve built we want to get to know you and your team. Show us your place on the Internet.

### Tags
Make is snappy, keep it relevant, what keywords would someone use to find you on Google?

### Identity
This list is only shared with the panel. We’re looking for email, Keybase, Telegram, phone number, etc. Any and all the places we can get in touch with you to talk about your project. The SCF is about relationships so make sure we have some bridges to get to you.
